🎉 Problem Solved! Your /server directory is now working correctly!

What Was Broken:

1. ❌ Missing Dependencies - All npm packages were listed as "UNMET DEPENDENCY"
2. ❌ No Environment Configuration - Missing .env file with database connection
3. ❌ Broken TypeScript Config - Incorrect configuration for Node.js development
4. ❌ Missing Development Scripts - No proper dev, build, or Prisma commands
5. ❌ Ungenerated Prisma Client - Database ORM wasn't set up

What I Fixed:

✅ Installed all dependencies - Express, TypeScript, Prisma, nodemon, etc.  
✅ Created .env file - With proper PostgreSQL connection template  
✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration - Proper CommonJS setup for Node.js  
✅ Updated package.json scripts - Added dev, build, start, and Prisma commands  
✅ Generated Prisma client - Database ORM is now ready to use  
✅ Configured nodemon - Hot-reload development environment  
✅ Tested the server - Confirmed it runs successfully on port 3001  

Your Server Architecture (Based on YouTube Tutorial Pattern):
NicksClient/
├── src/                    # Next.js Frontend (React)
├── server/                 # Express Backend API
│   ├── src/index.ts       # Main server file
│   ├── prisma/            # Database schema & migrations
│   ├── .env               # Environment variables (PostgreSQL)
│   └── package.json       # Server dependencies
└── package.json           # Frontend dependencies
Next Steps to Complete Setup:

1. Update Database Connection: Edit server/.env with your actual PostgreSQL credentials (local or AWS RDS)
2. Run Database Migration: cd server && npm run prisma:migrate (once DB is connected)
3. Add API Routes: Create routes in server/src/ for your inventory management features
4. Connect Frontend: Update your Next.js app to call http://localhost:3001 API endpoints

Quick Start Commands:
# Start the backend server (from /server directory)
cd server
npm run dev        # Development with hot reload
npm run build      # Build for production
npm start          # Run production build

# Start the frontend (from root directory)
npm run dev        # Next.js development server
Your server setup now matches the typical Next.js + Express + Prisma tutorial pattern from YouTube. The main issue was that the dependencies weren't installed and the configurations were incomplete. Everything should now work as expected!
